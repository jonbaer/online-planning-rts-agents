#Combat units are generally assigned actions by a tactical planner, however,
#the strategic planner is responsible for producing an army. Therefore
#combat units are represented by a single class with a name attribute and quantity attribute.
#A combat unit instance is defined for each type of combat unit not for each unit created (i.e. CombatUnit Marine defines
#an instance for combat units that are of type marine)  Combat units are not treated as separate objects since
#this simulator does not assign actions to units.  A tactical planner may look at combat units as a unary resource, but
#that is not the case for strategic planning.

	def __init__(self,name,exist = None,minCost=None,gasCost=None, durAmt=None,metalStoreCap,metalMake,nrgStoreCap,nrgMake) :
		#means creating a goal instance of the unary object
